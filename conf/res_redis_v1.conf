; Sample configuration file for res_redis.
;
; This module allows events to be shared amongst a local cluster of
; Asterisk servers via one or more redis servers. 
; Specifically, the types of events that may be shared include:
;
;   - Message Waiting Indication, or MWI (to allow Voicemail to live on
;     a server that is different from where the phones are registered)
;
;   - Device Change State
;
;   - Device State (for shared presence information)
;
